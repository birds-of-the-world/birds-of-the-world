    "text": "Version 15: Updated May 2025\n\nOverview\nThank you for volunteering to work on a Birds of the World (BOW) species account! We aim to make BOW the singular source for the collected biology of all birds of the world. This dynamic platform is made possible by merging two of the Cornell Lab’s flagship publications, Birds of North America (BNA) and Neotropical Birds (NB), with content from the renowned Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW Alive) and Bird Families of the World, originally published by Lynx Edicions. BOW is supported with real-time data from eBird and multimedia from the Macaulay Library (which now has incorporated considerable material originally archived in the Internet Bird Collection).\nOur ultimate goal is to generate authoritative and comprehensive species accounts for each of the roughly 11,145 species of birds in the world. This guide will review the basics of revising a species account, with guidance on content, style, and format. All account revisions are expected to follow these guidelines closely for consistency, clarity, and efficiency.\nTo be involved with the BOW project, you must review and abide by the policies for authorship, conduct, and content outlined in Appendix 1. You will also need to complete a Contributor Information Form (English, Spanish). You should aim to resubmit this form every two years to maintain your status as an active contributor.\nIn a typical revision, BOW staff will grant you “author access” to a draft account that you will be able to revise on the BOW website without your changes becoming publicly viewable. This draft will contain whatever was present in the most recent version of the account. You and/or your team should combine, edit, or remove this content as you add your own new content to the account.\nWhen you have completed your revision, please fill out the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish). BOW staff will then review the account and may request clarification, formatting, additions, or other changes. BOW staff will also add media (images, sounds, and figures and associated captions) and will fully edit and format the account as necessary. Once that is done, you will have a defined Author Review period to make any final changes to the account before it is considered ready to be published. Please endeavor to provide any final feedback you might have within this time period; once it has elapsed, the account may be published whether or not BOW staff have final confirmation from you.\nDetails about every step of the process are included in this document. Thank you for your efforts to make BOW an authoritative and dynamic resource!\nLead Editorial Team: Shawn Billerman (smb223@cornell.edu), Brooke Keeney (bkk37@cornell.edu), Fernando Medrano (fm458@cornell.edu), Nicholas Sly (nds22@cornell.edu), Maria Smith (mgs248@cornell.edu)\nThe Cornell Lab of Ornithology (http://www.birds.cornell.edu/) sponsors the BOW series and holds the copyright.",

    "text": "To edit or review an account, you will be working with a draft account for your species that is not visible to the general public. The steps below are a quick guide to help you access and edit (if applicable) the draft for your account:\n\n\nNavigate to https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/home and sign into your Cornell Lab account (if prompted). You can verify that you are signed in if you see a black silhouette of a person in the upper right of the page followed by your name and username in parentheses. Note, this should be your individual username, NOT an institutional or group name/login.\n\n\nOnce signed in, use the species search field or the taxonomic list to navigate to the species account you will be working on. The initial “Introduction” page you see when you search for your account is the “live” version of the account. The live version is not editable. You will need to access the “draft” version of the account to see or make changes.\n\n\nTo open the draft of the account to review or edit, click the orange button that reads “Version: Live - X.Y” at the top of the screen (the version number depends on how many times the account’s citable content has been updated). Select the “Draft” option from the drop-down menu.\n\n\nYou should see an orange bar across the top of the screen that says “REVISION.” That indicates that you are looking at the draft.\n\n\nTo review an account: You can navigate between pages in draft mode by using the index of articles on the left-hand side of the page or the navigation buttons at the bottom of each page. Typically, only the lead author(s) of a revision can edit the text during review; other reviewers are asked to submit their feedback as a Word document or email to the BOW staff member coordinating the review.\n\n\nTo edit an account: Click the orange button that reads “Edit Revision” that appears at the upper right of the text that you would like to edit. This will open up an online editor window. Once you open the online editor, the editing tools will be displayed in a menu bar near the top of the screen in your browser. You can hover over any of the buttons for a brief description of their functionality.\n\n\nThe white text box below the editor menu bar will show the draft version of the text. You can modify this text as necessary without affecting what people see in the live online version of the account on BOW. You can verify that you are editing the draft of the account by checking that there is an orange oval beneath the species name in the upper left corner of the editor window that says “REVISION.” Be sure to save your work using the buttons at the upper right of the screen.\n\n\nOnce you start editing and saving your changes, the live site (what the public sees) will still show the old version of the account and its associated media, but the draft pages will show your updated text.\n\n\nPlease consult the full author instructions for additional details about accessing the system, formatting, style, and anything else relevant to revising or reviewing an account. If you need further help, or have any questions, please contact Brooke Keeney (bkk37@cornell.edu) or Maria Smith (mgs248@cornell.edu).",

    "text": "Background knowledge\nTo understand the code examples used throughout this guide, some knowledge of the programming language R is required. If you don’t meet this requirement, or begin to feel lost trying to understand the code used in this guide, we suggest consulting one of the excellent free resources available online for learning R. For those with little or no prior programming experience, Hands-On Programming with R is an excellent introduction. For those with some familiarity with the basics of R that want to take their skills to the next level, we suggest R for Data Science as the best resource for learning how to work with data within R.\n\nTidyverse\nThroughout this guide, we use packages from the Tidyverse, an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. Packages such as ggplot2, for data visualization, and dplyr, for data manipulation, are two of the most well known Tidyverse packages; however, there are many more. In the following chapters, we often use Tidyverse functions without explanation. If you encounter a function you’re unfamiliar with, consult the documentation for help (e.g. ?mutate to see help for the dplyr function mutate()). More generally, the free online guide R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham is the best introduction to working with data in R using the Tidyverse.",

The free online book Geocomputation with R is a good resource on working with spatial data in R.\n\n\nSetup\n\nData package\nThe next two chapters of this guide focus on obtaining and preparing eBird data and environmental variables for the modeling that will occur in the remaining chapters. These steps can be time consuming and laborious. If you’d like to skip straight to the analysis, download this package of prepared data. Unzipping this file should produce two directories: data/ and data-raw/. Move both these directories so they are subdirectory of your RStudio project folder. This will allow you to jump right in to the modeling and ensure that you’re using exactly the same data as was used when creating this guide. This is a good option if you don’t have a fast enough internet connection to download the eBird data.\n\n\nSoftware\nThe examples throughout this website use the programming language R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023] to work with eBird data. If you don’t have R installed, download it now, if you already have R, there’s a good chance you have an outdated version, so update it to the latest version now. R is updated regularly, and it is important that you have the most recent version of R to avoid headaches when installing packages. We suggest checking every couple months to see if a new version has been released.\nWe strongly encourage R users to use RStudio. RStudio is not required to follow along with this guide; however, it will make your R experience significantly better. If you don’t have RStudio, download it now, if you already have it, update it because new versions with useful additional features are regularly released.\nDue to the large size of the eBird dataset, working with it requires the Unix command-line utility AWK. You won’t need to use AWK directly, since the R package auk does this hard work for you, but you do need AWK to be installed on your computer. Linux and Mac users should already have AWK installed on their machines; however, Windows user will need to install Cygwin to gain access to AWK. Cygwin is free software that allows Windows users to use Unix tools. Cygwin should be installed in the default location (C:/cygwin/bin/gawk.exe or C:/cygwin64/bin/gawk.exe) in order for everything to work correctly. Note: there’s no need to do anything at the “Select Utilities” screen, AWK will be installed by default.\n\n\nR packages\nThe examples in this guide use a variety of R packages for accessing eBird data, working with spatial data, data processing and manipulation, and model training. To install all the packages necessary to work through this guide, run the following code:\nNote that several of the spatial packages require dependencies. If installing these packages fails, consult the instructions for installing dependencies on the sf package website. Finally, ensure all R packages are updated to their most recent versions by clicking on the Update button on the Packages tab in RStudio.\n\n\neBird data access\nAccess to the eBird database is provided via the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) as tab-separated text files. To access the EBD, begin by creating an eBird account and signing in. Then visit the eBird Data Access page and fill out the data access request form. eBird data access is free for most uses; however, you will need to request access in order to download the EBD. Filling out the access request form allows eBird to keep track of the number of people using the data and obtain information on the applications for which the data are used.\nOnce you’ve been granted access to the EBD, you will be able to download either the entire eBird dataset or subsets for specific species, regions, or time periods. This is covered in more detail in the next chapter.\n\n\nGIS data\nThroughout this guide, we’ll be producing maps of species distributions. To provide context for these distributions, we’ll need GIS data for political boundaries. Natural Earth is the best source for a range of tightly integrated vector and raster GIS data for producing professional cartographic maps. The R package, rnaturalearth provides a convenient method for accessing these data from within R.\nThe data package mentioned in Data package contains a GeoPackage with all the necessary GIS data.",

    "text": "Full and Partial Revisions\nPlease review Appendix 1 for all policies regarding authorship, conduct, and content. It is assumed that contributors have read and will abide by these policies and have signed the BOW Contributor Agreement before beginning their revision.\nBOW contributors do not receive financial compensation for their work, although they do receive gratis access to BOW.\nFor an initial BOW revision, you will be given access to a draft account that contains text derived from the most recent BOW, Birds of North America (BNA), Neotropical Birds (NB), and/or Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW) species account (depending on your species’ geographic distribution). You can expect the following type of coverage from each original source:\nYou may edit, combine, or remove any or all of the existing text as you see fit as you populate new text and references into the account in the course of your revision.\nIf your account is for a species that was never covered by BNA or NB, the original HBW text will have been imported into the more comprehensive BNA/NB structure. When HBW text is present, it will have been imported into the first section of the page to which it correlates. Some of this text will likely be more appropriate in other sections or subsections, so we ask that you parse out whatever you choose to use into the most germane sections and subsections throughout the account (see Appendix 2). The HBW text may also include hyperlinks to images or other media originally from the Internet Bird Collection (or elsewhere). If these links are still functional, you may leave them in or remove them as you see fit. Please remove any broken links.\nPlease note, primary sources (i.e., the original published sources of information, often academic journal articles) are always preferred, and contributors should review original literature on the species to expand on, or replace, text from the above secondary sources (i.e., sources that contain information originally published elsewhere) to attain the appropriate level of detail in the account. Text originally derived from the HBW source project frequently did not contain references within the text. You should review the references (including the Additional References, which will contain HBW citations that are not referenced in the text) on the References page and, when possible and useful, ensure that those references are cited throughout the account’s text. See ?sec-content for further details on sources.\nA full revision will involve assessment of the entire account with updates across as many sections as appropriate, commensurate with the available publications on the species’ biology.\nA partial revision will involve a change to some of the citable content of an account without a comprehensive update to as many sections as possible. Some examples of partial revisions include an update of systematics/taxonomy, the addition of information from one or a few publications, and/or a revision of one or more sections by a specialist or BOW editor.",

    "text": "Authorship and Contributions to a Revision\nSee Appendix 1 for full details on authorship and contributions.\nBefore beginning a BOW species account revision, all relevant contributors should reach an agreement in advance on the following (if applicable):\n\nwhich contributor will take the lead on coordinating the revision effort, \nwhat each contributor will contribute to the revision, and\nthe order of authorship.\n\nNormally, the sequence of authors should reflect the relative cumulative contribution of each author to that version of the account, although a different sequence can be suggested by the authors if they agree among themselves. \nSince each BOW account is derived from one or more source publications, the original authors associated with each source account will be retained in the BOW citation inasmuch as the content they authored is still included in that version of the BOW account and justifies coauthorship.\nSeveral subject-matter experts are employed by BOW to supplement and standardize some of the most technical sections of an account (e.g., Plumages, Molts, Systematics, and Sounds and Vocal Behavior). Contributors will be asked on the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish) if they would like to use these experts’ services in their account. The work of these subject-matter experts may merit authorship, as per typical authorship policies, unless by prior agreement.\nBOW staff and contributors will be involved with the preparation of several elements of an account, which contributors will have the opportunity to review. Some elements that BOW staff frequently cover include: \n\nPhoto galleries and captions \nVideo galleries and captions (when applicable) \nPlumages, Molts, and Bare Parts\n\nIt is expected that contributors will review all contributions to the account prior to publication. In the event of any disagreements or conflicts, contributors should communicate with BOW staff to try and reach a mutually satisfactory resolution. If a resolution cannot be reached, contributors may choose to defer to BOW staff or end their participation in the project.",

    "text": "If completing a full revision, attempt to include information for all relevant sections of the account (see Appendix 2 for a list of sections and Appendix 3 for guidance on each section).\nCheck the Additional References on the References page of the account for any sources you might have missed during your literature search. This is especially important for accounts originally published in HBW since these typically did not involve an exhaustive survey of the literature.\nCite all statements in the account with a “reference tag” (see Step 5: Linking and Adding References), or note if the source of that statement is unpublished data, a personal observation, a personal communication, or an observation from eBird or a similar project (see References/Citations).\n\nException: Avoid using references in the Introduction unless you are providing a quotation or information that is not included elsewhere in the account.\nIf no published information is available, please note “Information needed.”\nIf you are preparing a full revision but did not evaluate a section, please note “This section was not evaluated.”\n\nFormat all new references that you have added according to BOW style (see Appendix 5). \nScan through the Literature Cited on the References page for any duplicated references (ordering the references alphabetically can be helpful) and replace as needed in the account text (see Step 5: Linking and Adding References).\nEnsure that any headings (e.g., text formatted as Heading 1 or Heading 2) are not bolded.\nUse “species tags” for all references to bird names (see Referring to Species).\n\nFor the focal species, use the common name only (except when use of the scientific name is more helpful, such as on some parts of the Systematics page).\nFor species other than the focal species, provide the scientific name and link to the BOW account the first time the species is named in each section of the account. For subsequent mentions of that species in the same section, use the common name only. For short pages, you may provide the scientific name and link only the first time the species is named on the page (rather than in each section).\n\nDo not use an s or *‘s* after a species tag to make the species name plural or possessive, respectively. Our translation process does not support this. Instead, reframe the sentence to use the singular of the species’ name.\nEnsure that the focal species is mentioned at the beginning of each page. Avoid beginning a page or section with “It,” as it should first be made clear that “it” refers to the focal species.\nUse lowercase for common names of nonbird species (but still capitalize proper nouns, e.g., Central American, European).\nEnsure that information in the first section on each page (i.e., the section that does not have a heading and is labeled “(introduction)” in Appendix 2) provides a general summary of the information on the page without repeating details given below. Avoid using citations in this section unless you provide information that does appear elsewhere on the page (this should be rare).\nFor all quantitative data, specify which measures are provided (e.g., mean, median, SD, or SE) or how a given measurement was taken (e.g., exposed culmen). Any number following a ± symbol needs to be specified as the SD or SE (e.g., 121.4 mm ± 1.02 SE). If this information is not reported in the original source, indicate that it is unspecified.\nVerify that any figures, media, and/or tables were prepared as per BOW standards (see Appendix 7).\n\nIf any part of the draft was previously published in another context, please obtain or ensure sharing permissions to republish it.\n\nCheck any link-outs in the text and remove any that are no longer functional.\nFollow American English conventions for spelling (e.g., gray instead of grey) and punctuation (e.g., use the serial or Oxford comma) (see Appendix 4).\nUse complete sentences of reasonable length to help make the account easy to read.\nRead over the draft for grammar, spelling, and referencing.\nFinalize a suggested author order (to be specified on the Draft Completion Form).\nVerify that all contributors have recently (within the last two years) signed and submitted a Contributor Agreement to BOW staff.\nFill out and submit the Draft Completion Form.",

    "text": "Contributors should aim to do an exhaustive literature search and populate text and references into as many of the pages, sections, and subsections as possible.\n\n\n\nContributors may choose to do multiple partial revisions and thus build toward a full revision through several intermediate partial revisions. When such an approach is taken, the first partial revision should give priority to the most outdated content and/or the author’s area of special expertise.",
