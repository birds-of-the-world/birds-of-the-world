    "text": "Version 15: Updated May 2025\n\nOverview\nThank you for volunteering to work on a Birds of the World (BOW) species account! We aim to make BOW the singular source for the collected biology of all birds of the world. This dynamic platform is made possible by merging two of the Cornell Lab’s flagship publications, Birds of North America (BNA) and Neotropical Birds (NB), with content from the renowned Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW Alive) and Bird Families of the World, originally published by Lynx Edicions. BOW is supported with real-time data from eBird and multimedia from the Macaulay Library (which now has incorporated considerable material originally archived in the Internet Bird Collection).\nOur ultimate goal is to generate authoritative and comprehensive species accounts for each of the roughly 11,145 species of birds in the world. This guide will review the basics of revising a species account, with guidance on content, style, and format. All account revisions are expected to follow these guidelines closely for consistency, clarity, and efficiency.\nTo be involved with the BOW project, you must review and abide by the policies for authorship, conduct, and content outlined in Appendix 1. You will also need to complete a Contributor Information Form (English, Spanish). You should aim to resubmit this form every two years to maintain your status as an active contributor.\nIn a typical revision, BOW staff will grant you “author access” to a draft account that you will be able to revise on the BOW website without your changes becoming publicly viewable. This draft will contain whatever was present in the most recent version of the account. You and/or your team should combine, edit, or remove this content as you add your own new content to the account.\nWhen you have completed your revision, please fill out the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish). BOW staff will then review the account and may request clarification, formatting, additions, or other changes. BOW staff will also add media (images, sounds, and figures and associated captions) and will fully edit and format the account as necessary. Once that is done, you will have a defined Author Review period to make any final changes to the account before it is considered ready to be published. Please endeavor to provide any final feedback you might have within this time period; once it has elapsed, the account may be published whether or not BOW staff have final confirmation from you.\nDetails about every step of the process are included in this document. Thank you for your efforts to make BOW an authoritative and dynamic resource!\nLead Editorial Team: Shawn Billerman (smb223@cornell.edu), Brooke Keeney (bkk37@cornell.edu), Fernando Medrano (fm458@cornell.edu), Nicholas Sly (nds22@cornell.edu), Maria Smith (mgs248@cornell.edu)\nThe Cornell Lab of Ornithology (http://www.birds.cornell.edu/) sponsors the BOW series and holds the copyright.",

    "text": "To edit or review an account, you will be working with a draft account for your species that is not visible to the general public. The steps below are a quick guide to help you access and edit (if applicable) the draft for your account:\n\n\nNavigate to https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/home and sign into your Cornell Lab account (if prompted). You can verify that you are signed in if you see a black silhouette of a person in the upper right of the page followed by your name and username in parentheses. Note, this should be your individual username, NOT an institutional or group name/login.\n\n\nOnce signed in, use the species search field or the taxonomic list to navigate to the species account you will be working on. The initial “Introduction” page you see when you search for your account is the “live” version of the account. The live version is not editable. You will need to access the “draft” version of the account to see or make changes.\n\n\nTo open the draft of the account to review or edit, click the orange button that reads “Version: Live - X.Y” at the top of the screen (the version number depends on how many times the account’s citable content has been updated). Select the “Draft” option from the drop-down menu.\n\n\nYou should see an orange bar across the top of the screen that says “REVISION.” That indicates that you are looking at the draft.\n\n\nTo review an account: You can navigate between pages in draft mode by using the index of articles on the left-hand side of the page or the navigation buttons at the bottom of each page. Typically, only the lead author(s) of a revision can edit the text during review; other reviewers are asked to submit their feedback as a Word document or email to the BOW staff member coordinating the review.\n\n\nTo edit an account: Click the orange button that reads “Edit Revision” that appears at the upper right of the text that you would like to edit. This will open up an online editor window. Once you open the online editor, the editing tools will be displayed in a menu bar near the top of the screen in your browser. You can hover over any of the buttons for a brief description of their functionality.\n\n\nThe white text box below the editor menu bar will show the draft version of the text. You can modify this text as necessary without affecting what people see in the live online version of the account on BOW. You can verify that you are editing the draft of the account by checking that there is an orange oval beneath the species name in the upper left corner of the editor window that says “REVISION.” Be sure to save your work using the buttons at the upper right of the screen.\n\n\nOnce you start editing and saving your changes, the live site (what the public sees) will still show the old version of the account and its associated media, but the draft pages will show your updated text.\n\n\nPlease consult the full author instructions for additional details about accessing the system, formatting, style, and anything else relevant to revising or reviewing an account. If you need further help, or have any questions, please contact Brooke Keeney (bkk37@cornell.edu) or Maria Smith (mgs248@cornell.edu).",

If you don’t meet this requirement, or begin to feel lost trying to understand the code used in this guide, we suggest consulting one of the excellent free resources available online for learning R. For those with little or no prior programming experience, Hands-On Programming with R is an excellent introduction. For those with some familiarity with the basics of R that want to take their skills to the next level, we suggest R for Data Science as the best resource for learning how to work with data within R.\n\nTidyverse\nThroughout this guide, we use packages from the Tidyverse, an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. Packages such as ggplot2, for data visualization, and dplyr, for data manipulation, are two of the most well known Tidyverse packages; however, there are many more. In the following chapters, we often use Tidyverse functions without explanation. If you encounter a function you’re unfamiliar with, consult the documentation for help (e.g. ?mutate to see help for the dplyr function mutate()). More generally, the free online guide R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham is the best introduction to working with data in R using the Tidyverse.",

The free online book Geocomputation with R is a good resource on working with spatial data in R.\n\n\nSetup\n\nData package\nThe next two chapters of this guide focus on obtaining and preparing eBird data and environmental variables for the modeling that will occur in the remaining chapters. These steps can be time consuming and laborious. If you’d like to skip straight to the analysis, download this package of prepared data. Unzipping this file should produce two directories: data/ and data-raw/. Move both these directories so they are subdirectory of your RStudio project folder. This will allow you to jump right in to the modeling and ensure that you’re using exactly the same data as was used when creating this guide. This is a good option if you don’t have a fast enough internet connection to download the eBird data.\n\n\nSoftware\nThe examples throughout this website use the programming language R [@rcoreteamLanguageEnvironmentStatistical2023] to work with eBird data. If you don’t have R installed, download it now, if you already have R, there’s a good chance you have an outdated version, so update it to the latest version now. R is updated regularly, and it is important that you have the most recent version of R to avoid headaches when installing packages. We suggest checking every couple months to see if a new version has been released.\nWe strongly encourage R users to use RStudio. RStudio is not required to follow along with this guide; however, it will make your R experience significantly better. If you don’t have RStudio, download it now, if you already have it, update it because new versions with useful additional features are regularly released.\nDue to the large size of the eBird dataset, working with it requires the Unix command-line utility AWK. You won’t need to use AWK directly, since the R package auk does this hard work for you, but you do need AWK to be installed on your computer. Linux and Mac users should already have AWK installed on their machines; however, Windows user will need to install Cygwin to gain access to AWK. Cygwin is free software that allows Windows users to use Unix tools. Cygwin should be installed in the default location (C:/cygwin/bin/gawk.exe or C:/cygwin64/bin/gawk.exe) in order for everything to work correctly. Note: there’s no need to do anything at the “Select Utilities” screen, AWK will be installed by default.\n\n\nR packages\nThe examples in this guide use a variety of R packages for accessing eBird data, working with spatial data, data processing and manipulation, and model training. To install all the packages necessary to work through this guide, run the following code:\nNote that several of the spatial packages require dependencies. If installing these packages fails, consult the instructions for installing dependencies on the sf package website. Finally, ensure all R packages are updated to their most recent versions by clicking on the Update button on the Packages tab in RStudio.\n\n\neBird data access\nAccess to the eBird database is provided via the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) as tab-separated text files. To access the EBD, begin by creating an eBird account and signing in. Then visit the eBird Data Access page and fill out the data access request form. eBird data access is free for most uses; however, you will need to request access in order to download the EBD. Filling out the access request form allows eBird to keep track of the number of people using the data and obtain information on the applications for which the data are used.\nOnce you’ve been granted access to the EBD, you will be able to download either the entire eBird dataset or subsets for specific species, regions, or time periods. This is covered in more detail in the next chapter.\n\n\nGIS data\nThroughout this guide, we’ll be producing maps of species distributions. To provide context for these distributions, we’ll need GIS data for political boundaries. Natural Earth is the best source for a range of tightly integrated vector and raster GIS data for producing professional cartographic maps. The R package, rnaturalearth provides a convenient method for accessing these data from within R.\nThe data package mentioned in Data package contains a GeoPackage with all the necessary GIS data.",

It is assumed that contributors have read and will abide by these policies and have signed the BOW Contributor Agreement before beginning their revision.\nBOW contributors do not receive financial compensation for their work, although they do receive gratis access to BOW.\nFor an initial BOW revision, you will be given access to a draft account that contains text derived from the most recent BOW, Birds of North America (BNA), Neotropical Birds (NB), and/or Handbook of the Birds of the World (HBW) species account (depending on your species’ geographic distribution). You can expect the following type of coverage from each original source:\nYou may edit, combine, or remove any or all of the existing text as you see fit as you populate new text and references into the account in the course of your revision.\nIf your account is for a species that was never covered by BNA or NB, the original HBW text will have been imported into the more comprehensive BNA/NB structure. When HBW text is present, it will have been imported into the first section of the page to which it correlates. Some of this text will likely be more appropriate in other sections or subsections, so we ask that you parse out whatever you choose to use into the most germane sections and subsections throughout the account (see Appendix 2). The HBW text may also include hyperlinks to images or other media originally from the Internet Bird Collection (or elsewhere). If these links are still functional, you may leave them in or remove them as you see fit. Please remove any broken links.\nPlease note, primary sources (i.e., the original published sources of information, often academic journal articles) are always preferred, and contributors should review original literature on the species to expand on, or replace, text from the above secondary sources (i.e., sources that contain information originally published elsewhere) to attain the appropriate level of detail in the account. Text originally derived from the HBW source project frequently did not contain references within the text. You should review the references (including the Additional References, which will contain HBW citations that are not referenced in the text) on the References page and, when possible and useful, ensure that those references are cited throughout the account’s text. See Account Content for further details on sources.\nA full revision will involve assessment of the entire account with updates across as many sections as appropriate, commensurate with the available publications on the species’ biology.\nA partial revision will involve a change to some of the citable content of an account without a comprehensive update to as many sections as possible. Some examples of partial revisions include an update of systematics/taxonomy, the addition of information from one or a few publications, and/or a revision of one or more sections by a specialist or BOW editor.",

    "text": "Overview\nBOW accounts are intended to provide comprehensive, up-to-date summaries of the known biology of all birds. The taxonomy of this series follows eBird/Clements and closely matches the North American and South American Classification and Nomenclature Committees.\nThese accounts should be written so as to stimulate new studies by indicating gaps in our present knowledge of species. In other words, BOW accounts should be “one-stop shopping” for individuals who are seeking a summary of what we know—and don’t know—about a species’ biology and suggestions on where to go for further details (i.e., through the references cited). Accounts are geared toward ornithologists and those with advanced interests in bird biology. As a result, they should also prove useful to wildlife biologists, scientists in other disciplines who study birds, avocational enthusiasts interested in avian ecology and behavior, biology teachers and students, land managers, and researchers who assess environmental impacts, among others.\nContributors should aim to provide a critically compiled, accurate, and concise summary of present biological knowledge (and ignorance) of a species. Updated sections of accounts should be built upon sound, established published data and interpretations of those data, as supplemented with new unpublished data when available. Contributors should summarize key observations, findings, and conclusions from new (and newly found) studies. While lesser findings in publications may not be covered in any detail, contributors can alert readers to the existence of these findings (“Smith (2014) also provided information on…”) so that readers can seek such material on their own if desired.\nIn some cases, contributors will come across published summaries or reviews of some aspect of the biology of their species, e.g., diet or vocalizations. Whenever possible, contributors should summarize key aspects and details of these reviews and not simply point the reader to another source. In most situations, contributors should take it upon themselves to conduct their own independent review of studies that have been summarized and cite the original studies in their account. Note, all text must be original; contributors should be careful to avoid plagiarizing work (either others’ work or their own previously published work).\nBOW content should be presented factually, objectively, and without bias, and authors should avoid imparting their personal opinions or interpretations. Rather, authors should present evidence-based information in such a way that readers have the necessary information to draw their own conclusions. Critiques of individuals, groups, groups of people, or specific studies (or similar) are not appropriate. BOW species accounts are generally not a venue for proposing new ideas; such ideas ought to appear and be judged first in the primary literature. However, as previously noted, contributors should highlight gaps in our knowledge. This includes not only pointing out data that are lacking but also raising as yet unanswered questions, such as unexplained structures or habits or deficient comparisons with related species. For topics about which little is known with certainty, contributors can state a probability, but this must be based on evidence; guessing should be avoided. When information is lacking, authors may include relevant information from closely related species. Make a special effort to report (or indicate ignorance about) habits and habitats used during the nonbreeding period, particularly for species that migrate to regions that are less well known. Try to relate different aspects of the species’ life history to each other, thereby characterizing the species’ distinctive qualities. Providing current and in-depth information, references, and research questions should be a powerful stimulus for new studies.\nA revision should strive to be both readable and useful. Species accounts will be read widely and translated into other languages, so their content should be clear and avoid regionally specific language and references that may not be understood by a global audience. Since BOW revisions are no longer printed documents, there is no need to use the very concise, telegraphic language (and abbreviations) necessary in the original species accounts. Although there are exceptions, contributors should use complete sentences and think about flow, readability, and the best ways to convey the information. BOW will continue to use the scientific/technical language required to discuss ornithological information, but please avoid being overly wordy and instead convey the information succinctly. If there is a need to summarize highly detailed information, the text can be abbreviated and use incomplete sentences to be more efficient (e.g., paragraphs with extensive details or summary statistics, such as descriptions of plumages, molts, and biometrics on the Plumages, Molts, and Structure page).\nWe encourage contributors to think about ways to enliven the text of their accounts, especially in the Introduction. This may include incorporating historical and/or influential quotes, discussing the cultural significance of the species, and/or including brief amusing anecdotes.",

    "text": "Sources of Information\nPlan to search widely for information to complete the revision. This includes reviewing not only recently published studies but also older publications, including those from the early 1900s and even before. Older literature that may have been difficult to identify or access when the original accounts were written may now be more widely available. Older publications often contain information on a species’ natural history of a kind that is rarely published these days. Such information can be invaluable in the present day in designing studies and interpreting results. Excellent places to find citations to, and PDFs of, older publications include Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/, ResearchGate: https://www.researchgate.net/, BioOne: https://bioone.org/, Biodiversity Heritage Library: https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/, and SORA: https://sora.unm.edu/. Internet Archive (https://archive.org/) can be helpful for accessing older books. Zoological Record (https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-referencing/web-of-science/zoological-record/) can also be a helpful resource if your institution has a subscription.\nBe sure to conduct searches using earlier versions of the species’ common and scientific names and/or names in other relevant languages. More and more, online searches will turn up accessible copies of older publications, e.g., at sites like Biodiversity Heritage Library: https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/. More recent publications can be identified using databases such as Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/) and Web of Science (https://www.webofscience.com/). If contributors are unable to find a resource online, either BOW staff or the interlibrary loan specialists at an author’s home institution may be able to locate it. Such librarians can be remarkably helpful and should, of course, be included in the Acknowledgments.\nSources of information should include all the published literature, including not only peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals but also books, book chapters, unpublished theses and dissertations (increasingly available online), and state, provincial, and federal government reports. Take special care to minimize regional biases, particularly for species that were originally included in BNA accounts, as older international literature may be absent from these accounts due to the geographic focus of their original series.\nFor certain sections of the account, contributors will also want to include information from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, eBird, and Christmas Bird Count. Contributors should also examine field guides and other “Birds of…”–type books specific to states, provinces, and regions and, especially, most recent editions of state and provincial breeding bird atlases, many of which are available online. Nest record card databases can also be a source of information. In some situations, an examination of museum specimens can be helpful in completing certain parts of the account.\nIn some cases, novel information about a species (e.g., nest structure or dietary associations) can be inferred from media in the Macaulay Library or other reputable archives (e.g., xeno-canto, Wikiaves, or iNaturalist). Whenever possible, BOW encourages contributors to submit these insights to peer-reviewed journals. Contributors may also include this information in BOW species accounts; however, the media and source archive must be properly attributed and cited (see References/Citations). Note also that caution is warranted when trying to infer context from a media asset.\nSimilarly, contributors are welcome to include their own unpublished data in the account, although BOW encourages contributors to also consider publishing these data in peer-reviewed journals. If unpublished data are to be included in BOW, contributors should provide readers with some information on how the data were collected. Include results of statistical analyses of these data where appropriate. \nContributors can also seek additional unpublished data from others but should take care to credit them appropriately. Including such data in a BOW species account does not preclude the owner from publishing them elsewhere at a later date. However, once these data are published, the citation in BOW should be updated.",

The ultimate goal is to have all BOW species converted to the expanded layout as information is populated.\nExpanded BOW accounts are partitioned into pages by subject matter. The order of these pages is standard across all species (see below): following an Introduction page there is a page on Identification, then Plumages, Molts, and Structure; Systematics; Distribution; Habitat; etc. \nWithin each page, there are a number of potential sections. For example, within the page on Systematics, there are sections on Geographic Variation, Subspecies, and Related Species. \nWithin sections, there can be a number of designated subsections, each with its own heading. For example, within the Eggs section on the Breeding page, two common subsections that are typically treated separately are Shape and Size.\nThe order of standard account pages, sections, and subsections appears in Appendix 2. \nGuidance for the appropriate content for each page and section appears in Appendix 3.\nBOW strives to maintain consistency from account to account in content and organization as much as possible. Many researchers use these accounts to do comparative studies between species (e.g., molt patterns, types of food eaten, nest structure, egg size, or natal philopatry); as such, they search for specific information in the same location within a series of accounts. As a result, contributors should follow the guidelines of Appendix 2 and Appendix 3 as closely as possible. \nWe recognize, however, that the biology of birds varies greatly from species to species. As such, there needs to be flexibility in the content of accounts. Exclusion of certain subsections is expected for some species (e.g., there would be no Timing and Routes of Migration subsection for a nonmigratory species).\nBOW staff will consider the addition of new sections or subsections; however, the order of standard sections and subsections, as shown in Appendix 2, should be retained, even if author-created sections or subsections are interspersed among them. Any new sections or subsections should be proposed to BOW staff via the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish) or email. If adopted, changes will be enacted as per BOW site developers’ timeframes.\nPlease note, any content imported from HBW is automatically added to the introductory section of each page (labeled with “(introduction)” in Appendix 2). This content should be parsed out into other sections and subsections, as appropriate.",

    "text": "Grammar and Formatting\n\nGrammar, Punctuation, and Style\nRefer to Appendix 4 for detailed information on grammar, punctuation, style, and formatting conventions.\nOlder accounts were written in a telegraphic style, and some sections (such as Plumages, Molts, Bare Parts, and Measurements) still call for a telegraphic presentation. With the transition to online publishing, there are no specific word limits or limits on the number of references used. Contributors should strive to be clear and concise and to use complete sentences wherever possible.\nBOW species accounts are and will continue to be translated from English into multiple languages. BOW and DeepL, the translation service used by BOW, maintain a glossary to aid these translations. Nonetheless, contributors should aim to spell out words and abbreviate less (e.g., spell out months, states, and provinces) and avoid words or phrases that could be ambiguous or incorrect when translated. Bird names are inserted via a “species tag” (see Step 3: Understanding the Editor Menu Bar) and thus will change automatically with a user’s language preferences; however, tags cannot be automatically translated by DeepL, so contributors should take care to write about a species in the singular and avoid possessives whenever possible.\nNote, however, that repeated use of longer words or terms (e.g., Endemic Bird Area [EBA] or Southeast Farallon Island [SEFI]) can become cumbersome for the reader. In such cases, terms should be defined at their first use in each section and may be abbreviated thereafter in that section (for short pages, the abbreviation may be defined just once per page). The same convention applies to scientific names.The main exceptions are measurements and statistics (m, km, min, yr, SD, p, CI, etc.), for which we use standard abbreviations that are not defined.\nPlease spell-check the manuscript as much as possible. The eBird/Clements Checklist is published in American English; thus, we ask that BOW accounts are written in American English for consistency (e.g., “gray,” not “grey,” and “molt,” not “moult”). Future site developments aim to enable authors to write in their preferred language.\n\n\nReferences/Citations\nPublished BOW accounts use a numbered reference system in which citations are represented by numbers in parentheses in the appropriate place in the text. Contributors are expected to go through and add linked citations to the text (see Step 5: Linking and Adding References). Once a citation is linked within a section of an account, our system will automatically assign it a number, and the reference will automatically appear on the References page in the order in which it is cited in the text (or alphabetically, by option). Thus, there is no need for cross-checking the citations in the text against the References page.\nWhen citing in the account text, please insert citations in parentheses and in chronological order with a comma and a space inserted between references, e.g., (Pyle 2017) or (Anderson et al. 2009, Smith and Anderson 2014, Pyle 2017). Citations from the same year should be listed alphabetically. Generally, citing at the end of the sentence is preferred, unless the aim is to highlight the work of a particular author(s). Additional conventions regarding citations are as follows:\n\nWhen citing observations/data of BOW account authors, please cite as: \n\n(J. Smith, personal observation) or (J. Smith, unpublished data)\n\nFor unpublished citations of people other than BOW account authors, please provide their full names in the Acknowledgments and cite in the main text as: \n\n(J. Smith, personal communication) or (J. Smith, unpublished data) \n\nWhen citing observations/data from a previous version of a BOW account from an individual who is no longer an author on the account, cite the previous version of the account and clearly credit the individual:\n\nR. E. Anderson found… (Jones et al. 1997)\n\nCiting articles as “in press” is acceptable, and these should be added as new references in the database. Please email us the full citation details once a paper has been published so that we can update the linked reference in the account.\n\n(Smith, in press) or (Smith et al., in press)\n\nNote: Manuscripts “in prep,” “in review,” or “submitted” should be cited in account text as “unpublished data” and should not be added to the reference database. \nWhen citing a specimen record, an eBird checklist, or a xeno-canto recording, please use the following format (note the hyperlinks):\n\nA female collected on 9 June had the bursa 4 × 2 mm and skull 50% ossified (University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute KU 131737).\nIn Halmahera, it also gives more downslurred buzzy shrills, each about 0.4–0.5 s, pitch ca. 6.0–7.2 kHz (M. Anderson, xeno-canto: XC497728).\nThere are two extralimital records. The first was an undocumented sighting record from Gili Trawangan (F. Dijkstra, eBird: S68127960).\nThe Chilean Pigeon has been observed bathing in shallow water (D. Ghigliotto, iNaturalist: 149930529).\n\n\nPlease see Appendix 4 and Appendix 5 for further details on style, formatting, and citations.",

Esto es especialmente para fichas del HBW, pues estas no incluían una revisión exhaustiva de la literatura.\nCitar todas las oraciones con un “reference tag” (véase Step 5: Linking and Adding References), o añada una nota de si la fuente es información no publicada, una observación personal, una comunicación personal, o una observación de eBird o similar (véase References/Citations).\n\nExcepción: Evitar usar referencias en la Introducción a menos que se esté incluyendo una cita textual o si no está incluido en otras secciones de la ficha.\nSi no hay información disponible sobre el tópico, añadir “Information needed.”\nSi estás preparando una revisión completa, pero no evaluarse una sección, por favor anotar “Esta sección no fue actualizada.”\n\nFormatear todas las referencias nuevas añadidas al estilo de BOW (véase Appendix 5). \nEscanee la Literatura Citada en la página de referencias para buscar referencias duplicadas (ordenar alfabéticamente es útil) y reemplace en el texto de la ficha para dejar solo una referencia (véase Step 5: Linking and Adding References).\nAsegurarse de que los títulos no están con negritas (e.g., texto formateado como Heading 1 o Heading 2).\nUsar “species tags” para todas las referencias a nombres de aves (véase Referring to Species).\n\nPara la especie focal, usar el nombre común solamente (excepto cuando se use el nombre científico sea útil, como en la sección de “Systematics”).\nPara especies que no sean la especie focal, proveer el nombre común y científico y linkear a la ficha BOW de esa especie la primera vez que la especie sea mencionada en cada sección. Para menciones subsecuentes de la especie en la misma sección, utilizar solamente el nombre común. Para páginas cortas, proveer el nombre científico solo la primera vez en toda la página (más que en cada sección).\n\nNo usar una s o ’s después de un “species” para dar un nombre plural o posesivo, respectivamente. Nuestro proceso de traducción automática no puede lidiar con esto. En vez de ello, replantee la oración para usar el nombre singular.\nAsegurarse que la especie focal es mencionada al inicio de cada página. Evitar iniciar una página o sección con “It,” pues debiese quedar claro que “it” se refiere a la especie focal.\nUsar minúsculas en nombres comunes de especies no aviares (pero colocar los nombres propios en general con mayúsculas, e.g., Central American, European).\nAsegurarse de que la primera sección de cada página (i.e., la sección que no tiene un título y que dice  “(introduction)” en el Appendix 2) provee un resumen general de la información de la página, sin repetir los detalles específicos. Evitar las citas en la sección, a menos que se provea información que no esté en otras partes de la página (aunque estos casos debiesen ser excepcionales).\nPara toda la información cuantitativa, especifique qué medidas son las que provee (e.g., mean, median, SD o SE) o el cómo la medida fue tomada (e.g., culmen expuesto). Cualquier número seguido de un símbolo “±” necesita ser especificado como SD o SE (e.g., 121.4 mm ± 1.02 SE). Si esta información no está reportada en la fuente original, indicar que no está especificada.\nVerifica que cualquier figura, media o tablas fueron preparadas con los estándares de BOW (véase Appendix 7). \n\nSi alguna parte del borrador fue publicada previamente en otro contexto, por favor asegurarse de tener permisos para republicarlos (e.g., figuras).\n\nChequear todos los enlaces y remover cualquiera que no esté funcionando actualmente.\nSeguir convenciones del American English para deletrear (e.g., “gray” en vez de “grey”) y puntuación (e.g., usar la “coma de Oxford”) (véase Appendix 4).\nUsar oraciones de un largo razonable, que permitan una lectura fácil.\nLeer el borrador, chequeando gramática, y que todas las referencias estén correctas.\nFinaliza el orden sugerido de la autoría (el cual será especificado en el Formulario).\nVerifica que todos los autores y autoras hayan enviado de forma reciente (en los últimos dos años) el acuerdo de contribución a Birds of the World.\nRellenar y enviar el Formulario de finalización del primer borrador de ficha BOW.",

In some cases, completing a full revision for a well-studied species may take six months or more.\nIf a revision will exceed the suggested timeline, contributors should communicate with BOW staff early and often. BOW endeavors to provide flexibility when it comes to the timing of revisions; however, in some cases (e.g., time-sensitive taxonomic updates, if the progress on a revision is overly slow, and/or if BOW staff are not able to communicate with the relevant contributors), the revision may be completed by BOW staff or others.",

Contributors will be asked on the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish) if they would like to use these experts’ services in their account. The work of these subject-matter experts may merit authorship, as per typical authorship policies, unless by prior agreement.\nBOW staff and contributors will be involved with the preparation of several elements of an account, which contributors will have the opportunity to review. Some elements that BOW staff frequently cover include: \n\nPhoto galleries and captions \nVideo galleries and captions (when applicable) \nPlumages, Molts, and Bare Parts\n\nIt is expected that contributors will review all contributions to the account prior to publication. In the event of any disagreements or conflicts, contributors should communicate with BOW staff to try and reach a mutually satisfactory resolution. If a resolution cannot be reached, contributors may choose to defer to BOW staff or end their participation in the project.",

Please use the Chrome browser to access the site and its editing tools. \nOnce you are on the BOW homepage, you should sign in using the username that you provided in the Contributor Information Form, as only this account will have the permissions required to edit and revise the species account you’re working on. You can verify that you are signed in if you see a black icon of a person followed by your name (username) in the upper right of the page. Note, you may need to widen the size of your browser window if you are confident that you are signed in but do not see the icon.\nNote: If you are accessing BOW from a connection with automatic institutional access, you may be automatically signed into an institutional account and will not have the correct permissions to access the draft. To sign into your individual account, click on the person icon and select “Sign in as different user.” This should enable you to sign into your individual account.\nOnce you are signed in, enter the name of your species in the search box at the center left of the home page or at the upper left of a species page. You can use the common name (as per your user account’s language settings), scientific name, or four-letter alpha code for the species to search for the account.\nOn the Introduction page (or if you navigate to any other pages in the account), you will see a black bar that says “Version: Live - X.Y” at the top of the screen. Clicking on this button will pull up a drop-down menu with all active versions of the account (“Live” = what the public sees, and “Draft” = the draft that you will be working on, which is not publicly available). You should select the draft, which will be the highest numbered version available: the numbers denote the version of the account, which is correlated with a unique and citable DOI (see Step 5: Linking and Adding References for a definition of “DOI”).\nOnce you have selected the draft version of the account, you will see an orange bar labeled “REVISION” at the top of each page of the account. You can click the “Edit Revision” button that appears at the upper right of each major section of text. This button will pull up an online editor from which you can edit the original text and build a draft account for your species.\nBe aware that each time you log back in to continue your revisions, your earlier work on a page or section will be visible only in the draft version of the account (not the live version).",

    "text": "Step 3: Understanding the Editor Menu Bar\nOnce you open the online editor, the editing tools will be displayed in a menu bar near the top of the screen in your browser. You can “hover” your cursor over any of the buttons for a brief description of their functionality.\nUnder the species name (at the top left of the screen) and next to the page name there should be an orange label that reads “REVISION.” This is your indication that you are editing the draft account.\nBelow is a series of screen captures that walks you through the functionality of the editor menu bar. In general, the editor menu buttons are standard, and they work the same as they might in most text editing software programs, such as Microsoft Word. Typical keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Control + V) also work, in addition to the button functions outlined below.\nLabeled in the image in red are the functions for the first five editor menu buttons:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two arrow buttons allow you to undo or redo your most recent change. The scissors icon allows you to cut highlighted text, while the two pages icon allows you to copy highlighted text, and the clipboard icon allows you to paste text.\nThe “Styles” drop-down menu allows you to format different levels of headings. Account subsection headings should be entered as “Heading 1” (do not bold manually), and any headings within those subsections should be entered as “Heading 2” (do not bold manually). See Appendix 2 for a list of pages, sections, and subsections.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext (in red) are buttons that allow you to bold text, italicize text, and format a scientific name or a vocalization. To use these buttons, highlight the text you would like to change, and then click the button corresponding to the change you would like to make. The italics, “Sci Name,” and “Vocalization” tags all give the same appearance (italicized text); however, the Sci Name and Vocalization buttons insert a hidden tag that allows our system to recognize the special formatting. In the future, this will allow the system to make automatic updates when taxonomy changes or to link up media.\n\nNote, you should use the Sci Name button only when italicizing genera, subspecies, and the scientific names of species other than birds. This may include discussions of historical taxonomy or subspecies taxonomy (e.g., “the subspecies flavicola”). The Species Name button (see below) should be used for all bird common names, scientific names, and binomials. For more information, see Referring to Species.\nPlease use the Vocalization button to italicize onomatopoeic vocalizations (e.g., Chuk call). Do not italicize descriptive vocalizations like “Alarm Call.”\n\nNext are buttons for subscript (e.g., x1) or superscript (e.g., km2). To use these buttons, use your cursor to highlight the character that will become the subscript or superscript, and then click the desired button. The Tx button removes any special formatting.\nThe chain link icon inserts a link to a URL. You may want to link to content elsewhere in the account or on an external website. To do this, use your cursor to highlight the word or phrase in the draft text that will anchor the link; click on the chain link icon (a short length of chain).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo insert a link to an external website, you will paste the URL of your destination into the URL box of the pop-up window and then click on the green “OK” button. Remember to always check the link to confirm that it is operational; you can do this after clicking “Save + View.” If the link needs to be removed or changed, just go back to the editor and right click on the blue (linked) text in the account. You can then click “Edit Link” or “Unlink” (or simply delete the linked text in the document).\nWhen inserting a link to a page or a section within an account (e.g., “see Demography and Populations: Population Status”), highlight the text in the draft to be linked, click on the chain link icon, and then click on the box labeled “Protocol” and select “&lt;other&gt;” (not “https://”). Specify the URL as simply its “PAGE#SECTION” portion. For example, “demography#popstat” (no spaces). You can determine how pages and sections are named in URLs by opening the account in a new tab and navigating to the relevant page or section using the links on the left side of the page. Copy the text after the final “/” in the URL and paste it into the box in the editor.\nWhen inserting a link to a specific page or a section within a different account, use protocol “&lt;other&gt;” (not “https://”) in the link tool and specify the URL as /bow/species/SPECIES_CODE/cur/PAGE#SECTION. For example, if you want to link to the Plumage section in the Red-throated Loon account, you will use: /bow/species/retloo/cur/appearance#plume\nYou can link only to pages or sections; if trying to link to a subsection, please link to the section that contains it, and leave the subsection unlinked.\nThe first time a bird genus or family is mentioned in a given section (or the first time it is used on a page if that page is short), please link to the relevant destination on BOW. Again, use the “&lt;other&gt;” protocol, and specify the URL as follows:\n\nFor a genus:\n\n/bow/species/gralla2/cur/species#genusGrallaria\nTo get the relevant text, go to the BOW account for any species in that genus. Click on the genus name near the top of the page. Use everything in the URL after the “.org”\n\nFor a family:\n\n/bow/species/gralla2/cur/introduction\nTo get the relevant text, search for the family in the BOW search bar and go to the relevant account. Use everything in the URL after the “.org”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Omega symbol (Ω) button provides access to special character menus. Clicking on the Ω button will bring up several menus of accented characters, mathematical symbols, etc. If you have trouble finding any symbols (e.g., ≤ ≥ ° ± × – —), we suggest that you copy/paste these from the internet or from Appendix 4.\nPlease DO NOT use the “Insert Table” button to insert a table at this time. Rather, follow the instructions for tables outlined in Appendix 7.\nThe next button allows for formatting of bullet points.\nTo search for or replace text in the text editor, click the magnifying glass icon. \nFinally, you should use the Species Name button when linking to a bird’s common or scientific name (or both). This button will insert a bird name as a “species tag” that will allow it to be displayed in different languages and facilitate automatic updates if the nomenclature changes. For more information on using the Species Name button and formatting for using species names in general, see Referring to Species.\n\nWarning: Species tags will retain the formatting of any replaced text (e.g., italics, Sci Name tags, bolding, or hyperlinks), so be sure to remove (unclick) any such formatting from the text you are replacing.\nThere may be cases when you do NOT want a species name to change with taxonomic changes (e.g., discussing the history of a name or taxon or discussing a subspecies). In these cases, the species name should be untagged (i.e., no species tag).\n\nThe “Media Link” and “Inline Media” buttons are intended for BOW curators, so please ignore these buttons. If you would like to include media in your draft, you can attach a Word document to the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish), or you can include Macaulay Library asset numbers in parentheses in the draft’s text itself. Refer to Appendix 7 for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last button (a page with arrows inside) allows you to view the HTML code for the text. You should not need to view the HTML under normal authoring circumstances.",

    "text": "Step 4: Revising the Draft Account\nYour draft account will contain the headings and all of the text that appeared in the most recent published version of the account. This content and structure may not align with current standards for BOW accounts, so be sure to compare what is in your draft with Appendix 2 and Appendix 3. \nWhen you are revising a draft account, you can modify the text, and/or add or subtract to/from it, as you add new text and references. Text from vertically stacked accounts (e.g., HBW accounts) will have been incorporated into BOW in its original form (i.e., unreferenced and in a single block of text that may correspond to several different sections/subsections in the BOW expanded account structure). You should read this text carefully and remove any inactive links. Whenever possible, you should replace this text with your own referenced summary of the primary literature. Do not assume that this text has been placed in the most appropriate section of the account: it may be that portions of that text correlate better to other sections or subsections of the account, and you should parse it out appropriately.\nWe recommend that you compose your draft directly in the text editor, but you can also cut and paste text into the editor from a Word document (or similar). Errors can be introduced during the “cut and paste” method, so we always suggest that you carefully review your work.\nBOW’s editing tools do not include a sophisticated spell-check feature, but when you are in edit mode and place the cursor in the text box, words that the text editor does not recognize are underlined in red. Most highlighted words are names that are unfamiliar to the text editor—scientific names, proper nouns (like names of authors or geographic features), etc.—but a careful perusal of flagged words often reveals an inadvertent typo. Unfortunately, this spell-check feature does not provide suggested alternative spellings—it falls on you to correct mistakes!\nSaving your work regularly and often is always a good idea! There are two ways to save your changes, which are denoted by the two blue buttons at the top right of the screen: “Save + View” and “Save.”\n“Save + View” allows you to save your work and then see how it appears in the draft account. Hitting this button will take you out of the editor and into the draft account. “Save” will save your work in the editor, but you will remain in the editing window. To exit the editor without saving any changes that you have made since the last save, click on the white “Cancel” button at the upper right of the toolbar. \nNote: The editor window will time out if left inactive for 60 minutes.\nIf you get an error message (“Sorry, you cannot access that page”) when trying to save your work, you have either hit the save button more than once, or another person might be editing the same section. When you get this message, if possible, you should copy your work to ensure that it is backed up. Alternately, to restore work that was not saved: (1) Click the orange “Sign In” button in the upper right corner. You should now see the editor window without your changes. (2) Click the “Back” button in your browser two times (not the back arrow in the editor window). You should now see the editor window with your unsaved changes restored. (3) Click “Save” immediately to save your work.\nYou can navigate between pages in revision mode by using the index of pages within the account on the left-hand side of the page or the navigation at the bottom of each page as long as you are actively working on the account. If you are logged out of BOW, you will see the “live” version of the text the next time you log in, and you will need to switch to viewing the revision again to see your revised text (see Step 2: Accessing the BOW Website).\nNote: Many aspects of a new version will not be finalized until after the Draft period. Media and figures are typically added to the draft during the Editorial Review period, and the account citation (which appears at the bottom of the screen) will not be fully updated from the previous version’s authorship until there is final consensus between the contributors and BOW staff on the authors and author order, usually during the Final Review period.",

    "text": "Step 5: Linking and Adding References\nBefore working with citations and references, we strongly encourage contributors to view a recently published account to view how numbered citations and references now appear.\nTo add a linked reference to your text, place your cursor where you would like the reference to appear, or highlight the text you would like a linked reference to replace, and then click on the blue “References” option that appears in the upper right of the editor window.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will open a reference module (see below) to the right of the main editing window. First, it is helpful to check the references already cited in the account using the “Account” button. If you see your desired reference in that list, simply click on it to insert a “reference tag” in the text. This tag will show up as a yellow box with the first author’s surname and publication year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the reference you would like to cite has not already been included in the account, you can search for an existing reference in the BOW master bibliography using the “Author,” “Publish Year,” “Title and/or Book Title,” or “Journal” fields. Putting information into these fields will pull up references that match the information you have entered. Once you find the reference you would like to use, you can click on it to insert the reference tag into the text. Often, you will need to enter only the first author’s surname and year to find the reference you are seeking. Note that any diacritical marks used in the author’s name will need to be used in the search box, so you might want to copy the author’s name from the publication and paste it into the search box.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: BOW’s master bibliography includes references from the BNA, NB, and HBW projects. As such, some references might occur in the master bibliography multiple times. Please make sure that if you use a reference that has multiple entries in our database, you are consistent in using the same one throughout the account you are revising. You can check this by looking for duplicates in the Literature Cited section when ordered alphabetically. When a duplicate is found, insert the reference tag for the version that most closely matches BOW’s format (or, if format does not differ, the version with a DOI or URL) into the text, and then replace all instances of the duplicate with that tag. Please also remember to check the list of references already associated with an account before adding one from the master bibliography.\nIn addition to searching for references by the fields listed above, you can also view recently added references to the account by clicking “Recent.”\nNote that not all references in the reference database are in the format now being used in species accounts. BOW staff are working to standardize reference format across all accounts.\nIf you would like to add a reference that does not appear in the search, you can click “Create.”\nFirst, select the publication type you would like to enter (Journal Article, Book Chapter, Book, or Other). Then, fill out (or copy and paste into) the fields as they appear on the “Create new reference” form.\nFor the “Full reference” field, you will insert the reference into the text field. The citation you input into that field is what will appear in the bibliography. Do not insert DOI or URL information into this field (see below). Please follow the format outlined in Appendix 5 when adding references.\nMoving down, the text in the “Author Prefix” field will determine how the author names should appear in inline citations (e.g., Smith, Smith and Jones, or Smith et al.). Please do not use “&” in this field; spell out “and” instead.\nThe “Authors,” “Year published,” “Article title,” and “Journal title” fields will allow the reference you are creating to be searchable in our reference database by author name, year, title, and journal, respectively. \nYou are also asked to provide the “DOI” number. This is a unique alphanumeric string assigned with each publication that allows it to be identified on the internet. While it may take some time to locate the DOI for some publications, providing it will help ensure that reference is correct and accessible.\nIf the material you are referencing is published exclusively online and does not have a DOI or come from an established scientific journal (e.g., it is an organization’s webpage or an online report), please include the URL. If you have DOI, there is no need to enter a URL.\nOnce you have completed the “Create new reference” form, you will review the information you entered. If your reference is similar to another in our database, the system will ask if you are entering a duplicate. If the information is correct and the reference is unique, then click the blue “Save” button. The reference will appear in the account bibliography and will be available in the reference search for linking in the text. If the reference you entered is indeed a duplicate, please do not create another reference. You should use the existing reference and notify BOW staff if that reference needs to be reformatted.\nAs an author, you can edit or remove references that you (and only you) have added to the bibliographic database. To do this, navigate to the References page of the account. There, you will see links to edit any references you have created (see example in screenshot below). If the reference has not yet been used in the account, you will also see a link to remove the reference. Each reference cited in the text must be listed on the References page and vice versa. Please make a final check for any unused references when the draft is complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: You cannot edit references that you did not create. You may find existing references that are incorrect or incomplete. In these situations, you should collect your suggested edits into a Word document that you submit via the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish) or alert BOW staff, who will make the changes for you.",

    "text": "Step 6: Account Review and Publication\nOnce you have completely finished the revision, you should collect any supplementary materials you would like to include with your draft (e.g., media requests, map edits, figures, or tables) and then fill out the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish), which will help us collate information relating to your draft. Please make sure that you include any necessary edits to the map, as map revisions can take BOW staff some time.\nIt is not necessary to change the status of each section from “Draft” (in red) to “Editor Review” (in orange); once sections are in the “Editor Review” state, they cannot be edited, so a BOW editor will change the state when they begin their review, allowing you to continue to make final tweaks while the draft is awaiting review. \nWhen we receive your form, your account will go into a review queue until BOW editors are able to look over your work. BOW staff will review and edit the text as needed and will begin to add media (images, videos, sounds, and figures), tables, and any formatting that is necessary for final publication. If your account is to be externally reviewed, it will be sent out during this period. \nOnce the Editor Review period is completed, BOW staff will email you a summation of any significant changes that were made to the draft’s text, as well as any issues in the account that require clarification or additional work (e.g., format, references, or more content for a particular section). The Author Review will typically be a one-month period in which you will be able to make final changes to the account before it is published online. A slightly longer period may be allotted if your account received an external review or if there are more extensive comments to address. This final review period is not intended for lengthy drafting, and contributors are asked to please avoid making changes to formatting (but please let us know if you have questions or note an inconsistency).\nDuring the Author Review period, all authors should read over the BOW editor’s comments, make any relevant changes, review the account in its entirety, and verify that the format and spelling of their name (e.g., initials to include) are displayed correctly in the citation. If you would like more time for review, please alert BOW staff as soon as possible. If BOW staff are not able to communicate with you, they will assume you will not participate in the review process further and will proceed with the draft’s publication. Any edits or feedback you submit after publication may still be incorporated into the account, although extensive changes may necessitate a new version.\nOnce your account is published, we encourage you to submit any additional minor edits or corrections by emailing Brooke Keeney (bkk37@cornell.edu) or Maria Smith (mgs248@cornell.edu).\nFinally, if you have questions about formatting or the best way to proceed with anything from a technical standpoint, please contact Brooke Keeney (bkk37@cornell.edu) or Maria Smith (mgs248@cornell.edu).\nThank you for all of your work! We look forward to your revision!",

    "section": "",
    "text": "1. Versioning and Revision History\nBirds of the World (BOW) species accounts are “living” and versioned documents that are intended to be regularly updated to incorporate new information and correct errors. BOW strives to enact account revisions and assign authorship as fairly and accurately as possible. This document (Appendix 1) is intended to define the policies and procedures of BOW content generation and the expectations of BOW contributors. To ensure fair and appropriate recognition of contributors and consistency over the years, BOW contributors and staff will adhere to the following guidelines to the maximum extent possible:\nTo ensure that each account’s content can be cited accurately over time, species accounts are given a new “version number” and a unique Digital Object Identifier (DOI) every time their citable content (i.e., text and references) changes.\nAccounts are versioned by number and source project (BNA, BOW, HBW, or NB), with the oldest versions corresponding to the lowest numbers. A full revision, i.e., an update to the majority of an account’s sections, corresponds to a “major” number change (e.g., from version 1.0 to 2.0 or version 1.1 to 2.0). A partial update (i.e., a noncomprehensive update affecting some but not most of an account’s sections) would correspond to a “minor” number change (e.g., from 2.0 to 2.1).\nOther changes that correspond to a minor number change can include a change in a species’ name (common or scientific) or higher classification or a change in the project to which an account belongs (e.g., BOW accounts are distinctly citable relative to accounts authored as part of the BNA, HBW, and NB projects), even if the content itself has not been changed significantly.\nVersion numbers do not change when BOW staff or contributors correct typos, update links, or make other small edits or changes. Maps, media, and changes in eBird-related products, such as Status and Trends visualizations or eBird occurrence maps (“purple maps”), are also not subject to versioning.\nEach BOW species account has a Revision History page that contains a stable archive of every version of an account. When available, each version has (1) a recommended citation with a version number and DOI, (2) a brief description of the changes from the previous version and (as appropriate) the names of the people involved in that version, and (3) a link to access that version as it was at the time of its publication.",

    "section": "2. Authorship Policies",
    "text": "2. Authorship Policies\nAuthorship of BOW accounts is determined by the relative cumulative contribution of each contributor to a given version, unless the contributor team and BOW staff jointly agree to an alternative arrangement. This policy ensures fair recognition of scholarly work while maintaining flexibility for special circumstances.\nA contributor’s “cumulative contribution” encompasses both new content added to a version and any retained content from previous versions attributed to them. Contributors with the most substantial cumulative content will be listed first in the citation. Those with more modest contributions may appear later in the author list or, if their contributions fail to rise to the level of authorship, may be acknowledged in the account’s Revision Notes. Previous authors and deceased authors will retain authorship on new versions provided enough of their attributed content remains.\nAll contributors to a new version should agree on a preliminary author sequence early in the revision process, understanding that this order may require adjustment as work progresses to reflect actual contributions. In cases where contributors cannot reach consensus on authorship order, BOW staff will mediate the situation through consultation with all parties involved.\nWhen submitting a revision for editorial review, contributors must review these authorship policies (Appendix 1) and indicate their proposed author sequence on the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish). While BOW staff hold the ultimate authority in determining authorship and citation order, they will carefully consider contributors’ suggestions and discuss any proposed changes with affected parties. Editors strive to apply authorship criteria consistently and fairly across all accounts.\nWhen cumulative contributions cannot be clearly differentiated, BOW staff may sequence author names in the citation in alphabetical order or, for sectional contributors, in the order their content appears in the account, unless alternative arrangements are mutually agreed upon.\nAn account may incorporate text from multiple contributors over time. Authors may be removed from the author list either at their request or if editors determine that insufficient attributed content remains in the current version. However, original published versions and their authorship will be preserved in the Revision History. Contributors must specify on the Contributor Information Form (English, Spanish) if they wish to be notified of authorship changes.\nWhen unpublished data or observations from previous authors are retained in new versions, these should be cited appropriately with reference to the previous account. For example: “Anderson in Jones and Anderson (1998).” Such contributions will be preserved in the Account History and can be noted in the Acknowledgments section.\nTo maintain authorship status, authors are encouraged to actively participate in updates to their work over multiple versions. Engaged contributors in good standing can consult with BOW staff regarding the timing and implementation of future updates to their accounts.",

    "section": "3. Maintaining Status as an “Active” Contributor",
    "text": "3. Maintaining Status as an “Active” Contributor\nTo remain maximally useful for research and conservation, BOW species accounts require regular updates, and previous contributors are encouraged to maintain ongoing involvement with their work. Beginning in 2025, contributors must review and renew their Contributor Information Form (English, Spanish) and associated Contributor Agreement every two years to maintain “active” contributor status. This requirement ensures current contact information and continued engagement with the BOW project. Contributors who become “inactive” may forfeit their ability to influence revision timing and implementation, and BOW staff will no longer be obligated to contact them.\nContributors should clearly indicate their preferred contact methods and desired level of involvement on the Contributor Information Form. While BOW staff will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate these preferences, they reserve the right to override preferences that unnecessarily impede account updates or conflict with BOW’s goals and ethical standards.\nWhen contacting contributors who have requested notification, BOW staff will use the provided contact information. If no response is received within two weeks, staff will proceed with identifying alternative contributors for a species account. A simple acknowledgment of communication is sufficient to maintain “active” status.\nActive contributors retain the right to to consult on how and when their work is updated. While all contributors in good standing are always welcome to be involved with their work regardless of active status, those who become inactive are expected to collaborate constructively with any new contributors appointed during their inactivity.\nBOW staff will endeavor to maintain as much communication with former and current contributors as reasonably possible; however, staff may initiate revisions of accounts without contacting the previous authors if (1) an account lacks active contributors, (2) there is no progress or communication for one year following a proposed update, or (3) BOW staff decide to terminate a contributor’s involvement (typically due to unsatisfactory performance, agreement violations, excessive delays, or other inappropriate conduct).",

    "section": "4. BOW Content Standards",
    "text": "4. BOW Content Standards\nBOW maintains rigorous academic and professional standards for all content. Plagiarism, copyright violations, or the use of content that has been generated via artificial intelligence are not permissible (also see the BOW artificial intelligence policy). Content should be objective and unbiased and should rely upon published information whenever possible.\nBOW maintains strict ethical standards and has zero tolerance for:\n\ndiscriminatory content or behavior based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, etc. \nscientific misconduct, including data fabrication or manipulation, plagiarism, or intellectual property violations\nharassment, hostility, or retaliation against contributors or staff\nconflicts of interest that are not properly disclosed\nethical violations in research methods or personal conduct\ncultural insensitivity in describing indigenous knowledge or practices \n\nNote that plagiarism herein is defined as the usage of uncredited, derivative content. All text should be in your own, original words, and any text taken directly from another source, including text that you wrote in other citable contexts, should be placed within quotation marks. All information that originated from another source must be cited (see References/Citations and Appendix 5).\nBy participating in the BOW project, contributors assert that their content and behavior abide by these standards and that their content is the original work of the attributed contributors. Violations may result in immediate termination of participation and removal of content. BOW staff will investigate any concerns promptly and thoroughly.\n\nChanges to Content\nWhile BOW staff endeavor to preserve the integrity of contributors’ original work, editorial modifications may be necessary to ensure alignment with BOW’s established standards and guidelines. When a substantial revision is called for, editors will endeavor to provide comprehensive feedback detailing significant changes and necessary modifications. Contributors who do not adequately address these requirements may face additional editorial intervention, rejection of submitted materials, or removal of content. Should disagreements arise regarding content or editorial changes, BOW staff will engage in constructive dialogue with the concerned parties to reach a resolution. In instances in which consensus proves unattainable, BOW staff maintain ultimate editorial authority over platform content, though contributors retain the right to withdraw their submissions and discontinue their participation in the project.\nIn addition to changes made during the course of a draft’s editorial review, changes to BOW species accounts may be made by subject-matter experts. BOW editors strive to maintain consistency from account to account. As such, certain conventions must be followed, and certain language must be used, especially with regard to systematics/taxonomy, molts/plumages, and the structure/organization of vocal outputs. To ensure a standard treatment of such sections, BOW staff may assign expert contributors (including staff members) to revise specific sections or assist in their revision. Authorship for these contributions follows the standard policies, unless by mutual agreement.\nContributors have three options regarding specialized content: \n\nContributors may request (or leave to an editor’s discretion) that a BOW subject-matter expert prepares the specialized content, which contributors can then review and edit, if necessary, prior to publication. This is the most common approach. BOW staff will arbitrate any content disputes.\nContributors may opt to prepare the material themselves after informing BOW staff of their intent, typically via the Draft Completion Form (English, Spanish). Expert contributors will review this content, ensure compliance with BOW conventions, and suggest necessary changes. BOW staff will mediate any content disagreements. \nContributors may collaborate with a subject-matter expert during content preparation. The details of such collaborative efforts must be worked out early in the revision process.\n\nOn occasion, there may be an immediate need to revise certain parts of an account within a strict time frame (e.g., during BOW’s annual taxonomic update or if a species’ conservation status changes). These changes may result in a version change. Typically, BOW staff will make the required changes themselves or ask a contributor to do so, but smaller changes, like common name changes, may happen automatically. While active contributors will be notified of any significant content changes that are needed or planned, they may not be informed of minor taxonomic alignments with the eBird/Clements Checklist, such as changes to subspecies or genus-level changes.\nSuitable contributors and/or subject-matter experts who are not involved in a revision a priori may be invited to review accounts before publication at the discretion of BOW staff. Contributors may request external review but cannot prevent it if deemed necessary by editors. Reviewers will be acknowledged in Revision Notes and will submit feedback via a Word document or email, making direct edits only with mutual agreement of BOW staff and the relevant contributors.",

    "text": "INTRODUCTION\nIn general, when you cannot find information on a given topic, please fill in that section with “Information needed” or “Information is needed” (not with “No information,” “No data,” or “Nothing known”). Similarly, use statements like “Additional information needed” instead of “No other information.” If you did not search for literature for a section(s), you may note “This section was not evaluated.” For sections or subsections in which there might not ever be any relevant information for a species because the behavior does not apply (e.g., Nonbreeding Nests, Cooperative Breeding, or Brood Parasitism by Other Species), use “Not reported.”\nPlease avoid using the words “recent” or “recently” in accounts. This is a relative term, and some accounts are updated more frequently than others, which can lead to misleading statements in some cases. Please try to provide the relevant year (or range of years) whenever possible.\nAll accounts should include a concise introduction of 1–5 paragraphs. Introduce your species to the reader, emphasizing aspects that make it unique, including (as appropriate) systematics, appearance, distribution, migration, habitat, foraging, breeding, population size, and conservation. The best introductions are not simply a summary of factual details but strive for readability while still reflecting the science within the account. Descriptions of appearance should be concise and are generally not the focus of the Introduction. Descriptions of range should be general (e.g., occurs in montane forests of Tanzania and Kenya, typically from 2,600–3,400 m). Introductions generally do not include cited references unless a quote is included or information that is not cited elsewhere in the account is presented. Some accounts have summarized aspects of the species that are well studied, providing citations, especially at the end of the Introduction.",

    "section": "FIELD IDENTIFICATION",
    "text": "FIELD IDENTIFICATION\n\nField Identification (introduction)\nIf the Identification article is particularly long, summarize the most important aspects of the identification of the species, including the essential field marks. A bulleted list may be appropriate here.\n\n\nIdentification\nProvide a general summary description of the major points of identification for adults and juveniles by sex (when age and sex can be determined). The terms “adults” or “first-cycle birds” can be used here, but be sure to include the plumage(s) in parentheses following the terms, as listed under Plumages. “Juveniles” can be used for birds in Juvenile Plumage without the need for the extra term. Include separate descriptions for adults in Definitive Basic and Definitive Alternate Plumages if they differ (or state that they are similar if an alternate plumage occurs and is similar in appearance to basic plumage). After adults of each sex and plumage are described, briefly describe Juvenile, Formative (usually), and all other predefinitive plumages in about one sentence each. When appropriate, discussion of subspecies, notable morphs or color variants, or otherwise unique populations can be briefly included.\nThe diagnosis should be scientific rather than that of a field guide, but it should also be easy to read and digest by novices. Stress features of size, shape, color, or structure that can be recognized on birds in the field. Give the overall (general) length and mass of live birds, accompanied by a statement of relative size compared to related species if useful for identification (e.g., a medium-sized hummingbird). Report any differences in length, mass, or plumage between males and females. Keep this section succinct. Detailed descriptions of size, color, etc., will be called for in other sections. No subsections are needed for this section.\n\n\nSimilar Species Summary\nIf the Similar Species section is of substantial length (5+ paragraphs), please use the Similar Species Summary to briefly summarize the key issues. Avoid too much repetition with Similar Species, however.\n\n\nSimilar Species\nSummarize the major points of identification that distinguish your species from any closely related or otherwise similar species. Cite any recent papers that thoroughly discuss how to distinguish your species from similar species in the field, but do not include references to standard field guides. Identification among subspecies (or morphs, variants, etc.) may also be briefly included here, although any detailed description of subspecies appearance should be included in the Subspecies section on the Systematics page. Keep this section succinct. Detailed descriptions of size, color, etc., will be called for in other sections. No subsections are needed for this section.",

    "text": "If completing a full revision, attempt to include information for all relevant sections of the account (see Appendix 2 for a list of sections and Appendix 3 for guidance on each section).\nCheck the Additional References on the References page of the account for any sources you might have missed during your literature search. This is especially important for accounts originally published in HBW since these typically did not involve an exhaustive survey of the literature.\nCite all statements in the account with a “reference tag” (see Step 5: Linking and Adding References), or note if the source of that statement is unpublished data, a personal observation, a personal communication, or an observation from eBird or a similar project (see References/Citations).\n\nException: Avoid using references in the Introduction unless you are providing a quotation or information that is not included elsewhere in the account.\nIf no published information is available, please note “Information needed.”\nIf you are preparing a full revision but did not evaluate a section, please note “This section was not evaluated.”\n\nFormat all new references that you have added according to BOW style (see Appendix 5). \nScan through the Literature Cited on the References page for any duplicated references (ordering the references alphabetically can be helpful) and replace as needed in the account text (see Step 5: Linking and Adding References).\nEnsure that any headings (e.g., text formatted as Heading 1 or Heading 2) are not bolded.\nUse “species tags” for all references to bird names (see Referring to Species).\n\nFor the focal species, use the common name only (except when use of the scientific name is more helpful, such as on some parts of the Systematics page).\nFor species other than the focal species, provide the scientific name and link to the BOW account the first time the species is named in each section of the account. For subsequent mentions of that species in the same section, use the common name only. For short pages, you may provide the scientific name and link only the first time the species is named on the page (rather than in each section).\n\nDo not use an s or *‘s* after a species tag to make the species name plural or possessive, respectively. Our translation process does not support this. Instead, reframe the sentence to use the singular of the species’ name.\nEnsure that the focal species is mentioned at the beginning of each page. Avoid beginning a page or section with “It,” as it should first be made clear that “it” refers to the focal species.\nUse lowercase for common names of nonbird species (but still capitalize proper nouns, e.g., Central American, European).\nEnsure that information in the first section on each page (i.e., the section that does not have a heading and is labeled “(introduction)” in Appendix 2) provides a general summary of the information on the page without repeating details given below. Avoid using citations in this section unless you provide information that does appear elsewhere on the page (this should be rare).\nFor all quantitative data, specify which measures are provided (e.g., mean, median, SD, or SE) or how a given measurement was taken (e.g., exposed culmen). Any number following a ± symbol needs to be specified as the SD or SE (e.g., 121.4 mm ± 1.02 SE). If this information is not reported in the original source, indicate that it is unspecified.\nVerify that any figures, media, and/or tables were prepared as per BOW standards (see Appendix 7).\n\nIf any part of the draft was previously published in another context, please obtain or ensure sharing permissions to republish it.\n\nCheck any link-outs in the text and remove any that are no longer functional.\nFollow American English conventions for spelling (e.g., “gray” instead of “grey”) and punctuation (e.g., use the serial or Oxford comma) (see Appendix 4).\nUse complete sentences of reasonable length to help make the account easy to read.\nRead over the draft for grammar, spelling, and referencing.\nFinalize a suggested author order (to be specified on the Draft Completion Form).\nVerify that all contributors have recently (within the last two years) signed and submitted a Contributor Agreement to BOW staff.\nFill out and submit the Draft Completion Form.",
