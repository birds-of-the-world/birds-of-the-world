# Draft Submission Checklist {#sec-checklist .unnumbered}

Before submitting the Draft Completion Form ([English](https://forms.gle/e6uTR5E8Z5aXXc9n6), [Spanish](https://forms.gle/4e3PifYqvKrbQ1tV8)), please ensure that you do the following:

-   If completing a full revision, attempt to include information for all relevant sections of the account (see [Appendix 2](https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app2.html) for a list of sections and [Appendix 3](https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app3.html) for guidance on each section).

-   Check the Additional References on the References page of the account for any sources you might have missed during your literature search. This is especially important for accounts originally published in HBW since these typically did not involve an exhaustive survey of the literature.

-   Cite all statements in the account with a “reference tag” (see @sec-edit-five), or note if the source of that statement is unpublished data, a personal observation, a personal communication, or an observation from eBird or a similar project (see @sec-content-grammar-references).

    -   Exception: Avoid using references in the Introduction unless you are providing a quotation or information that is not included elsewhere in the account.

    -   If no published information is available, please note “Information needed.”

    -   If you are preparing a full revision but did not evaluate a section, please note “This section was not evaluated.”

-   Format all new references that you have added according to BOW style (see [Appendix 5](https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app5.html)). 

-   Scan through the Literature Cited on the References page for any duplicated references (ordering the references alphabetically can be helpful) and replace as needed in the account text (see @sec-edit-five).

-   Ensure that any headings (e.g., text formatted as Heading 1 or Heading 2) are not bolded.

-   Use “species tags” for all references to bird names (see @sec-app4-species).

    -   For the focal species, use the common name only (except when use of the scientific name is more helpful, such as on some parts of the Systematics page).

    -   For species other than the focal species, provide the scientific name and link to the BOW account the first time the species is named in each section of the account. For subsequent mentions of that species in the same section, use the common name only. For short pages, you may provide the scientific name and link only the first time the species is named on the page (rather than in each section).

-   Do not use an s or 's after a species tag to make the species name plural or possessive, respectively. Our translation process does not support this. Instead, reframe the sentence to use the singular of the species’ name.

-   Ensure that the focal species is mentioned at the beginning of each page. Avoid beginning a page or section with “It,” as it should first be made clear that “it” refers to the focal species.

-   Use lowercase for common names of nonbird species (but still capitalize proper nouns, e.g., Central American, European).

-   Ensure that information in the first section on each page (i.e., the section that does not have a heading and is labeled “(introduction)” in [Appendix 2](https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app2.html)) provides a general summary of the information on the page without repeating details given below. Avoid using citations in this section unless you provide information that does appear elsewhere on the page (this should be rare).

-   For all quantitative data, specify which measures are provided (e.g., mean, median, SD, or SE) or how a given measurement was taken (e.g., exposed culmen). Any number following a ± symbol needs to be specified as the SD or SE (e.g., 121.4 mm ± 1.02 SE). If this information is not reported in the original source, indicate that it is unspecified.

-   Verify that any figures, media, and/or tables were prepared as per BOW standards (see [Appendix 7](https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app7.html)).

    -   If any part of the draft was previously published in another context, please obtain or ensure sharing permissions to republish it.

-   Check any link-outs in the text and remove any that are no longer functional.

-   Follow American English conventions for spelling (e.g., "gray" instead of "grey") and punctuation (e.g., use the serial or Oxford comma) (see [Appendix 4](https://birds-of-the-world.github.io/birds-of-the-world/app4.html)).

-   Use complete sentences of reasonable length to help make the account easy to read.

-   Read over the draft for grammar, spelling, and referencing.

-   Finalize a suggested author order (to be specified on the Draft Completion Form).

-   Verify that all contributors have recently (within the last two years) signed and submitted a [Contributor Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Arz8mqAamqQFlIfV2zNJFQbbB5Y0D4Ug/view?usp=sharing) to BOW staff.

-   Fill out and submit the Draft Completion Form.
